IF
--

This is a very very very early commit of a very very very
nasty port from Perl of some very very very old code.

Don't use this unless you're very brave.

This code is under heavy development as of right now,
May 2, 2010.  It is being ported at a fairly rapid rate
from a Perl framework that is stable.  This port can
not be considered stable in any way at all.  However,
hopefully this will change soon.

What is IF?
-----------

IF is based on the web framework and ORM previously
in use at Idealist.org.  The original framework was
developed in-house but heavily influenced by WebObjects
and EOF.  Porting it to Objective-J seemed fitting
and convenient; it also fills a gap in providing
an ORM and web framework written in Objective-J;
something which is currently lacking.

Status
------

The name "IF" will change.  The API is in a state
of flux.  The code itself was partially machine-
ported, so it's pretty crazy-looking (on top of
being based on old, crazy-looking Perl).
